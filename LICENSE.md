# License for the Stitch Monorepo

License information for the content of this git repository. The various packages in this repo are developed by [Butterscotch Shenanigans](https://www.bscotch.net) ("Bscotch").

## License files

Whenever a `LICENSE` file is found in a folder, or a license is specified by a `package.json` or similar manifest file, that license takes precedence for all files in that folder and its subfolders.

This is the root-most `LICENSE` file, and therefore dictates the default licensing in this repository.
