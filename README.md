# Stitch Desktop (Archive)

[Butterscotch Shenanigans](https://www.bscotch.net) ("Bscotch") develops and maintains a collection of tools for management of [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io) projects. These tools are collected under the umbrella trademark "Stitch".

This repository contains the source code for the deprecated "Stitch Desktop" application, which has been [replaced by the Stitch for VSCode](https://github.com/bscotch/stitch/issues/138) extension. It is provided here for reference purposes, and to allow others to fork and continue development if they so choose.
